I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.

Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Meh. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!

I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

We don't have a brig. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. No argument here. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! No! Don't jump!

    Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
    That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
    No! The cat shelter's on to me.

And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Well, then good news! It's a suppository. But I've never been to the moon! There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!

    As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.
    Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
    Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!

And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.

Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

And until then, I can never die? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. We're also Santa Claus! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Throw her in the brig.

Also Zoidberg. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! And until then, I can never die? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Shut up and get to the point!

Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Moving along… I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

Your best is an idiot! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. It doesn't look so shiny to me.

You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? I'm Santa Claus! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Why would I want to know that?

Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Bender, we're trying our best. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.

Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? You are the last hope of the universe. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?
